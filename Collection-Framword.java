                  // Question: What is the Java Collections Framework, and name a few interfaces from it?


// The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces that provide commonly reusable collection data structures.
// Some interfaces from the framework include:-

// #List:-     An ordered collection (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
// #Set:-      A collection that does not allow duplicate elements (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
// #Map:-      An object that maps keys to values (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
