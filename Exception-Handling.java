                             //Question: How does exception handling work in Java?


// Exception handling in Java is done through the use of try, catch, finally, throw, and throws.
// The try block contains the code that might throw an exception.
// The catch block is used to catch and handle exceptions.
// The finally block contains code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not.


Example:

try {
    // code that might throw an exception
    int result = 10 / 0;
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // handle the exception
    System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
} finally {
    // code that will be executed regardless of an exception
    System.out.println("Finally block");
}
// These are just a few examples, and there are many more important concepts and questions in Java. If you have specific topics or types of questions you're interested in, feel free to ask!
