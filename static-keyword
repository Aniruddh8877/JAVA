                       // Question: What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java?


The static keyword in Java is used to create class-level members. It means that the member (method or variable) belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
static members are shared among all instances of the class and can be accessed using the class name.

Example:
public class Example {
    static int count = 0;  // static variable

    static void incrementCount() {
        count++;  // static method
    }
}
